description: '<p>In January 2017, the City of Zurich invited Huber/Sterzinger to design a poster series for the «500 Years of Reformation» anniversary. The posters are based on visual associations drawn from historical and contemporary references, advertising, art, newspaper-clippings etc.</p> <p>This publication gathers the printed poster motifs in an image inventory and draws the portrait of a highly ambivalent city between morality and turmoil, harmony and anticipated emergency, innovation and conservatism, ambition and anticipatory obedience, social responsibility and luxury consumerism.</p>'
