description: '<p>This issue of Pamphlet deals with the perception, visualization, and representation of distinct parts of Zurich and offers different ways of representing the city – both above ground and underground – by analyzing five unique sites, each of which represents a multifaceted, layered and spatially complex system: the ETH main building, Zurich main station, the Jelmoli department store, the Sihl River, and the Schanzengraben and adjacent Old Botanical Garden. Each site is approached from two perspectives: the visual aesthetic perspective of student works that accurately visualize the site through point cloud modelling; and the perspective of experts who have a special relation to the site or knowledge of the applied methods and technologies, thus contributing insights from urban history, city planning, architecture, and landscape architecture.</p>'
