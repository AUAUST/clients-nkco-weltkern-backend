description: '<p>Enghelab Street, or Revolution Street, is located in the center of the Iranian capital Tehran&#8211;a main artery in the city&#8217;s cultural life with a host of bookshops. This book presents a variety of rarely seen photographic and propaganda books collected by Iranian-born, Paris-based artist Hannah Darabi (born 1981), drawing on works published between 1979 and 1983&#8211;years corresponding to the short period when freedom of speech prevailed at the end of the Shah&#8217;s regime and the beginning of the Islamic government. Darabi takes us to the heart of an intense artistic and cultural period in Iranian history in a visual essay accompanied by a critical essay by Chowra Makaremi. With its revelatory landscape of publications, Enghelab Street: Iran 1979-1983 gives us the opportunity to look at rare printed matter for the first time.</p>'
