description: |
  <p>A sandwich can be so much more than an item of food consisting of bread with a filling. The making of a sandwich is a tasteful and relational creation, sprinkling community, criticality and cultural economy.</p>
  <p>Ranging from sculpture, found imagery, drawing and much more, Breadcrumb compiles and reflects upon forty-one sandwich recipes by artists from different places across the globe, presenting the sandwich as a fuzzy, expanding object, lacking strict definition.</p>
  <p>The Breadcrumb cookbook brings artistic value to everyday life and instigates thought as well as food for digestion. Buen provecho.</p>
