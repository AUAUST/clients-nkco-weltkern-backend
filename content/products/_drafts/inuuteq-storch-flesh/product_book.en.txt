description: '<p>For a period of time the Greenlandic photographer Inuuteq Storch lived in New York City. Here he found himself spiritually at home but homesick in his body. Growing up in a place, where nature dominates everything, his body, unlike his soul, missed being close to nature. Those feelings together created a very specific way of looking at his surroundings. He started finding images that represented familiarity in this unfamiliar place.</p>'
