  <p>You are probably wrong, but that’s because it was your first thought, at first sight. Preconceptions shape your mind. You have to let ambiguity in, as a friendly visitor that molds your mind. How does this space looks like? What is it used for? Who are the people and objects inhabiting it? Can you imagine?</p>
  <p>It are all pieces of a puzzle that doesn’t need to be resolved. Some pieces bear names, others don’t. Elegant, powerful, complex, boring, suggestive, black, white, silent, calm, real, fake. Fragments of a space. Colors are black and white. They give personality to this space. On his turn, this space gives credibility to situations by showing a visual code with common rules. Feel free to ignore these rules. Be curious. Shades of black and white fall over your shoulders. They hide and they show. Situations, details, atmosphere.</p>
