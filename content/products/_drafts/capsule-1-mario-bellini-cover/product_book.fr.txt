  <p>A hybrid between a magazine and a book, paying homage to a lineage of Italian radical design publications while indulging in a lavish physicality, Capsule will be released annually during Milan Design Week. Delving into the world of design in its broader definition through a genre-bending line up of designers, architects, and creators, the first issue comes with a set of three covers.<br />
  <br />
  Featuring: Nanda Vigo, Alessandro Mendini, Green River Project, Mario Bellini, Nakagin Dreams, Plastic Drip, Karim Rashid, Atelier Van Lieshout, Devon Turnbull, and Eugene Whang.</p>
