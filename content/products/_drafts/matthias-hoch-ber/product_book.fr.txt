description: '<p>BER 2017-2020: An airport without planes, a terminal without passengers. Berlin-Brandenburg Airport, code BER, was an unfinished major project for a long time, half-finished, functionless, in a state of waiting. Over a period of three years, Matthias Hoch explored this place of standstill with a large-format analogue camera, like an archaeologist: room by room &#8211; from the station to the pier, from the landside to the airside, following the gaze of a possible user. The result is images of an enigmatic construct; images of a place where the not-yet seems to be followed only by a not-more: a conundrum of time. Matthias Hoch, photographer, born 1958 in Radebeul, lives in Leipzig. Kathrin Röggla, writer, born 1971 in Salzburg, lives in Cologne. Thomas Weski, curator, born 1953 in Hanover, lives in Berlin.</p>'
