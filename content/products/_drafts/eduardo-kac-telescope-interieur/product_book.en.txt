description: '<p>The work <em>Télescope intérieur</em>, designed by artist Eduardo Kac to exist in zero gravity, was created on board the International Space Station by French astronaut Thomas Pesquet in February 2017. It was the first step towards a new form of artistic and poetic creation, free from the constraints of gravity. This book, composed in a triptych &#8211; the story, the work, the interview &#8211; evokes the genesis of this extraordinary project, gives a glimpse of its creation in Space and explains the artist&#8217;s intentions.</p>'
