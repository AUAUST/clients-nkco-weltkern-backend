description: |
  <p>The Wood Wood 2-22 book is an introduction to, and a look back at, Wood Wood and the first 20 years of the brand’s history. The label’s archive has been delved into by ­Copenhagen/Milan-based ­design duo, Wrong ­Studio. The outcome is a carefully compiled selection of ­material, organised in a non-­chronological format ­reflecting Wood Wood’s non-linear creative journey.</p>
  <p>Fragments, sketches and photographs from past ­collections and collaborations have been ­juxtaposed to tell the story of a clothing brand in constant flux. The result is a slightly chaotic, intensely visual ­representation of the ­Copenhagen label.</p>
  <p>The image heavy pages are supplemented by a ­section of technical information, brief commentary from past collaborators and an ­interview with the founders, ­offering an insight into the roots of Wood Wood.</p>
