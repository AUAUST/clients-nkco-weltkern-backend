description: '<p>Matter lies like the skin, it moves between genres. <em>Hand Smoothed by Coin</em> is a collection of works that combine and intertwine to form an accumulative portrait of objects moving between art and design. The book presents material extracted from three events: Palimpsest by Fos (Nils Stærk gallery, 2018), <em>After Palimpsest</em> by OK-RM with Fos and Esther Theaker (Them Magazine Issue No.20, Winter 2018), <em>Hands Smooth by Coins</em> by Fos (Copenhagen Contemporary, 2019). The book is section sewn with an RGB gatefold at its core, presented in a silkscreened PVC jacket holding an 8pp concertina insert. </p>'
