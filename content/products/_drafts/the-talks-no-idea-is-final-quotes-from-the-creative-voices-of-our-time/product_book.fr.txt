  <p>An inspiring collection of quotes from The Talks, a much-loved online magazine featuring candid interviews with visionaries</p>
  <p>Over the last decade, The Talks has conducted more than 500 interviews with cultural visionaries &#8211; illuminating conversations with artists, actors, directors, chefs, fashion designers, architects, authors, musicians, and athletes.
