description: |
  <p>How does the complex structure of the image today connect to perception, what does this visual culture offer and what is left to the perceiver?</p>
  <p>As we find ourselves in a culture of digital media, wherein Design, Cinema and New Media intersect, this book zooms in on the image’s dynamic factors seen as a field of work in which the creation of contents and forms is inscribed in a post-digital era.</p>
