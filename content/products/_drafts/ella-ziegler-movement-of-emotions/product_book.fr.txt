  <p>The artist publication <em>Movement of Emotions</em> examines in four volumes inter- personal interactions and movements, as well as their atmospheric resonances in social, physical and emotional space. Ella Ziegler is interested in how biogra- phy, culture and ideology inscribe themselves into our individual and collective memorial body and how personal, social and political spaces are permanently constituted through conscious and unconscious body language.<br />
  <br />
  The four books Defence, Does the Ground Feel the Tears?, Three Minutes Third Space, and Feigned Unconsciousness are a differentiated observation and investigation of culturally variable emotionally motivated body languages that are learned in the course of a lifetime and intuitively expressed and decoded in familiar contexts. Ella Ziegler transcribes memories and conversations into de- tailed descriptions of actions and transforms quotations into poetic narratives.<br />
  <br />
  The interweaving of image, text and monochrome colour surfaces creates four different reference spaces, each with its own rhythm and open syntax.</p>
