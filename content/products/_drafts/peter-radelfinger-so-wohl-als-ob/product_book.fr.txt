  <p>This book presents a wide range of artistic working processes that Peter Radelfinger developed and implemented together with students in various disciplines during the many years he taught at Zurich University of the Arts: several series of elementary (to begin with, drawing and performing) exercises,<br />
  strategies and techniques of working with images, researching, artistic actions and complex artistic projects.</p>
  <p>Radelfinger tries to lay down precise coordinates that will serve to broaden his students’ perceptions and understanding of art, routinely setting parameters<br />
  that establish a “minimal order” within which they’ll have maximum room for maneuver. Radelfinger combines his idiosyncratic artistic approach with his pedagogical and didactic know-how. Not for nothing does he insist his teaching is part and parcel of his artistic practice.<br />
  <br />
  This book, in turn, sets about creating a “minimal order” for the next playful round of artistic consciousness expansion. Serving neither as documentation of Radelfinger’s courses nor as conventional teaching material designed to put across a specific method, this is an exciting handbook that provides plenty of food for further reflection – and action.<br />
  <br />
  This book comprises multiple pictorial and textual levels: it’s a montage of (outside) texts and pictures with cross-references and background information about everyday life as well as (contemporary) art and art history. The texts and pictures are interlinked with a view to opening up new avenues of thought. The images do not show completed works, they document working processes and designs for the most part produced in class.<br />
