description: '<p>Sunset Cocktails is an invitation to transform contemplation into a sensory experience of assimilation of the world to literally drink the sunset.</p> <p>Based on Guillaume Aubry’s esthetic research on the artistic and mystical yet daily figure of the sunset, Sunset Cocktails presents 12 cocktails devised by mixologist Sterling Hudson.</p> <p>From the dazzling Regulus, whose saffron ice cube spreads its light in the vermouth, to Grand Soir, a political sunset that infuses the charcoal into the vodka.</p> <p>In a luminous afterword, Ryoko Sekiguchi awakens our senses and our bodies to receive fascination for an aesthetic and gustatory experience.</p> <p>The circular outline of the sun becomes visible to the naked eye.<br /> The blinding light softens and ceases to burn the pupil.<br /> The heavenly body melts and dilutes its bitterness into a sensorial experience of the world.<br /> Astonishment of an esthetic sunset.</p>'
