description: |
  <p>Tracer in English means a tool for tracing, the person tracing, and also the trace. Tracer also refers to the professions of graphic artist or technical draughtsman. The series of drawings called Tracer (2021/22) was done for the publication of the same name. Using graphite on A3 sheets of paper Mathis Pfäffli has created a kind of picture story in which real buildings encounter fictive spaces; futuristic architecture meets hybrid landscapes with leafless trees and technoid objects. They blend to form fantastic and partly uncanny worlds following a logic of their own. </p>
  <p>The publication Tracer contains the complete series of drawings called Tracer, a survey of Pfäffli’s artistic work, with texts by Chantal Kaufmann, Julia Moritz, Sophia Roxane Rohwetter, and Arnaud Wohlhauser.</p>
