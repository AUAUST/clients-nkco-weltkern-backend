  <p>Released on the occasion of Peter Sutherland&#8217;s solo exhibition hosted at Spazio Maiocchi in May 2021, curated by KALEIDOSCOPE and supported by Carhartt WIP and Slam Jam.<br />
  <br />
  Titled “Colorado,” the exhibition featured a new body of work comprised of medium- and large-format photographs, and a new series of collages, and a billboard commission. The accompanying book by the same title, designed by Swiss art direction firm Kasper-Florio, will feature the complete series of photographs and collages, a conversation with Leo Fitzpatrick, and a foreword by Maia Ruth Lee.<br />
  <br />
  After twenty years in New York, during lockdown the artist decided to leave the city and move back to his native Colorado—resulting in a body of work brimming with nature, punctuated by hikes, camping, and fortuitous encounters. In the artist’s own words, “A lot of my work is autobiographical: I’ve used photography to document my own experiences—and being from Colorado, nature was always part of those experiences. Many New Yorkers see nature as a vacation space, but even after all those years there, I’ve never lost the sense of the city being the vacation spot, and nature being home.”<br />
  <br />
