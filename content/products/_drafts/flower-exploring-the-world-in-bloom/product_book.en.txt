description: |
  <p>A comprehensive and sumptuous survey that celebrates the beauty and appeal of flowers throughout art, history, and culture<br />
  <br />
  Take a journey across continents and cultures to discover the endless ways artists and image-makers have employed floral motifs throughout history. With 316 color illustrations showcasing the diversity of blooms from all over the world, Flower spans a wide range of styles and media – from art, botanical illustrations, and sculptures to floral arrangements, film stills, and textiles – and follows a visually stunning sequence with works, regardless of period, thoughtfully paired to allow interesting and revealing juxtapositions between them. Flower is follows in the footsteps of Plant: Exploring the Botanical World, which Martha Stewart Living described as &#8220;breathtaking.&#8221;</p>
