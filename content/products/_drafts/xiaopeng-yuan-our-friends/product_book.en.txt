description: '<p>In February 2017, we lost our friend Ren Hang, a Chinese artist who suffered from depression for years and committed suicide this year at age of 29. When hearing this sad news, we fled to Beijing immediately, and so did other friends of his. It is a dark time for everyone especially the closest friends of Ren Hang’s. All photos in Our Friends were taken from 25th to 27th February 2017, it is a documentary for Ren Hang’s funeral, a farewell to our close friend.</p>'
