  <p>This issue inaugurating the fall season aims to reflect and expand on the concept of biodiversity in nowadays&#8217; visual arts. Trying to expand the notion of biodiversity, it means in a way thinking on it as a growth of ecosystem productivity, where each species has an important role to play. From technology, the AI, the &#8220;molecular turn&#8221;, etc—all essential players within a huge number of artists productions. Spanning from different researches and approaches all artists involved in this issue, titled &#8220;Ultra Bodies Ultra Species&#8221;, are designing a new scenario of the art world.</p>
