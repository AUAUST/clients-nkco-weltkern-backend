description: '<p>“To what extent can territory planning be considered meaningful? At what level its artificiality does more damage to the territory than improvisation? There are natural needs of using land that are best filled through improvisation, in those situations where urban planning fails to represent it and, there are needs, which despite of being collected by an urban plan, end up creating more precarious urban situations than spontaneous urbanism itself.”</p>'
