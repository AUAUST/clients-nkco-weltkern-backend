  <p>An exclusive homage to – and retrospective of – the iconic fashion designer&#8217;s couture accessories.<br />
  <br />
  &#8216;One can never overstate the importance of accessories. They are what turns a dress into something else. I like dresses to be sober and accessories to be wild&#8217;, Yves Saint Laurent, 1977.<br />
  <br />
  <em>Yves Saint Laurent Accessories</em> is the first book to date to shed light on the breathtaking accessories created by one of the most influential fashion designers of all time. From his first collection in 1962 to his acclaimed final presentation in 2002, Yves Saint Laurent created exquisite jewellery, hats, shoes, and handbags to complement and enhance each of his couture creations. Beautifully designed, in a small format evocative of a jewellery box, the book offers an unprecedented glimpse into the highly confidential archives of The Yves Saint Laurent Foundation in Paris, which is home to over 20,000 remarkable accessories. The book features specially commissioned photography of the accessories alongside a treasure trove of rare materials including preparatory sketches, intimate portraits of Saint Laurent at work, behind-the-scenes snapshots of models, catwalk photographs, and advertising campaigns. <em>Yves Saint Laurent Accessories</em> introduces readers to a prominent yet rarely seen side of Saint Laurent&#8217;s art, leading them backstage and through the history of a house that helped to shape the course of fashion.</p>
