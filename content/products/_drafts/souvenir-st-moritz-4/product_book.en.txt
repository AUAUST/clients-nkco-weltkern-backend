  <p>« Souvenir » is a series of yearly art photobooks published by St. Moritz, launched in 2019. It shows the views of artists on St. Moritz. Souvenir St. Moritz Volume 4 is a unique collaboration between two British artists: David Sims and Jake Chapman. 304 pages, 500 limited copies. Release: April 2023.</p>
  <p>David Sims (born 1966) is a British fashion photographer who first made his name in the early 1990s with magazines such as The Face and i-D. Sims was born in Sheffield. He worked first as a photographer&#8217;s assistant with Robert Erdmann and Norman Watson. He was taken on by a photography agency and his work began to feature in editorial pages of magazines such as i-D, The Face and Vogue. He has also worked in advertising, creating images for brands such as Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Calvin Klein, Jil Sander and Yohji Yamamoto.</p>
  <p>Iakovos &#8220;Jake&#8221; Chapman (born 1966) and Konstantinos &#8220;Dinos&#8221; Chapman (born 1962) are British visual artists, often known as the Chapman Brothers. Their subject matter tries to be deliberately shocking, including, in 2008, a series of works that appropriated original watercolours by Adolf Hitler. In 2022, with the announcement of Jake Chapman&#8217;s solo show Me, Myself and Eye, it was disclosed that the Chapman brothers had ended their professional association.</p>
