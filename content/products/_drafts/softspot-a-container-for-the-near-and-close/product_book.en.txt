description: |
  <p><em>softspot</em> is a fragile space seeking to make sense of a complex now. Through a collaborative process of editing and exchange between James Taylor-Foster and OK-RM, softspot is a dive into the recent past. Imagined as a container for the near and the close, it contains a patchwork of prose, verse and visual work that oscillate between the subjective and the objective. Written through the lens of one writer and augmented by a conversation of contributions and references, the book represents a study in how words can be written — and how they can be held in a hand.</p>
  <p>Conceived of and compiled during 2020 and 2021 with Esther Cloe Theaker, Max Creasy, Rosita Kær, Smari R. Robertsson, Tony Karlsson Savci, and Michela Zoppi.</p>
  <p>Each softspot contains three copies of the same book. You are invited to keep one and to gift the others as you wish.</p>
