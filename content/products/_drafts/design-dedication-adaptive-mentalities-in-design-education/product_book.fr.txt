description: |
  <p>This book explores an attitude in and toward design education that is socially engaged, politically aware, generous in approach, lyrical in tone, experimental in form and collaborative in practice. How can we talk about and draw out the political aspect inherent in the work of design students? What are the underlying values of such a pedagogy? What kind of practices are developed in this context? How can an institute support and safeguard this?<br />
  <br />
  <em>Design Dedication</em> explores these approaches through statements from within and reaches out to design students, designers, artists and teachers who are open to questioning their own practices and reformulating values in design education in the face of an unpredictable tomorrow.</p>
