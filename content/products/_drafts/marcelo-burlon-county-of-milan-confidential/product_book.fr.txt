description: |
  <p>Marcelo Burlon is the driving force and originator behind County of Milan. He is a trailblazer who moves across milieus and disciplines with remarkable ease, embodying that defining contemporary quality: liquidity. Averse to cultural and geographic borders, Burlon is first and foremost a polymath: a much sought-after party organizer, DJ, designer, photographer, nightlife wizard, and general aggregator. Invention, for Burlon, is in the mix.</p>
  <p>His biography provides the background to this fluid vision. Marcelo Burlon, in fact, has been immersed in a culturally varied milieu from day one, having been raised in El Bolsón, Argentina, where the first hippies merged with gauchos. Transplanted to Italy while barely a teenager, he made his way into nightlife, then took over Milan to conquer the world.<br />
  The endeavor started with a bunch of t-shirts in 2012, but a complete collection quickly ensued, turning into both a social and commercial phenomenon. Its inclusive message got the fire started: County of Milan is all about embracing and celebrating diversity, as the brand&#8217;s highly spectacular, intensely emotional shows testify.</p>
  <p>This illustrated book follows the structure of a police investigation report, with a suspect, interrogations, evidence, accomplice profiles, and an affidavit describing Marcelo&#8217;s biography, brand, tribe and creations.</p>
