description: '<p>Swiss photographers Monika Fischer (*1971) and Mathias Braschler (*1969) decided to take one portrait every day on their thirty-thousand-kilometer journey across China. Most of the time they did not know whom they would meet, and so along the way they created an astonishing, kaleidoscopic view of the country&#8217;s diverse population, a cross-section of all of society&#8217;s classes, ethnicities, and age groups. Their series of documentary photos shows both the winners and losers emerging from the overwhelming changes in the enormous country: the farmer who lives just a couple of kilometers away from the Chinese space center but still plows his small farm with a team of water buffalos; the filthy-rich owner of a yacht club, posing casually in front of his purple Lamborghini; or the little girl from the traveling circus, standing on the table that serves as her stage. Braschler and Fischer give them names, describe their stories, and maintain their dignity.</p>'
