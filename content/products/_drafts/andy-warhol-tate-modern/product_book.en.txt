description: '<p>&#8220;Andy Warhol Now&#8221; is the catalogue for the retrospective at the Musem Ludwig in Cologne, which impressively illustrates his status as a Pop Art icon with 100 works, but includes his migrant background and homosexuality with a contemporary view.</p> <p>As an underground art star, Andy Warhol was the antidote to the macho American postwar art scene who redefinded the language of painting, sculpture and film. This humanistic re-visioning explores his background as a child of an emigrant family, his ideas about death and religion and his queer perspective, revealing an artist who both succeeded and failed in equal measure and whose work marked a period of cultural transformation that still resonated today. Exploring Warhol&#8217;s knowing flirtation with the commercial world of celebrity alongside his advocacy of alternative lifestyles, it presents his work within the the context of his time in a way that connects to contemporary concerns.</p>'
