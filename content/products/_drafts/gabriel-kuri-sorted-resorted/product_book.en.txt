description: '<p>Gabriel Kuri‘s sculptural practice is strikingly material and this book – like the exhibition at WIELS that it accompanies – adopts material as its organizing principle. It underlines the importance of sorting as a recurring thread in Kuri’s practice and then resorts his works into four categories: paper, plastic, metal, and construction materials. While this liberates the works from the dictates of chronology or narrative, it is a deliberately absurd approach to complex, conceptually – driven sculptures that are rarely made of just one element.<br /> <br /> The publication features an introduction by senior curator Zoë Gray and an essay by art historian Cathleen Chaffee (Chief Curator, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo), and four texts exploring our material world by Brian Dillon (author, Professor of Creative Writing at Queen Mary, University of London).</p>'
