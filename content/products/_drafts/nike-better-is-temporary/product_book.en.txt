  <p>At Nike, the desire to be the best is a journey, not a destination—better is always temporary.<br />
  <br />
  Phaidon commemorates the company&#8217;s influence with <em>Nike: Better is Temporary</em>, a landmark publication that charts Nike&#8217;s transformation from rebellious upstart to global phenomenon.<br />
  <br />
  This immersive visual survey offers an unprecedented, behind-the-scenes exploration into Nike&#8217;s ethos-driven design formula, placing industry-defining innovations and globally recognized products alongside previously unpublished designs, prototypes, insider stories, and more.<br />
  <br />
  Beginning with &#8220;Breaking2,&#8221; an introduction detailing Nike&#8217;s 2017 attempt to facilitate a sub-two-hour marathon, the book lays out in five thematic chapters Nike&#8217;s focus on performance, brand expression, collaboration, inclusive design, and sustainability.<br />
  <br />
  The book&#8217;s extraordinary design also nods to its contents. The striking cover features overlapping silkscreened layers of Nike&#8217;s proprietary Volt yellow and Hyperpunch pink colors overlaying an image of world-champion marathoner Eliud Kipchoge printed in a half-tone dot pattern. The book&#8217;s spine, visible through the clear jacket, showcases a series of colored tabs that extend from its interior pages and which are referenced in the book&#8217;s bonus chapter, &#8220;Crafting Color.&#8221;<br />
  <br />
  Combining 500 color illustrations with stories, insights, knowledge, passion, and history shared by Nike&#8217;s remarkable team, <em>Nike: Better is Temporary</em> will serve as a manual of innovation and inspiration for generations to come.</p>
