  <p>This magazine explores two extreme cases of urbanized shallow water territories – Markermeer/IJsselmeer in the heart of the Netherlands and the Venetian Lagoon. One is probably the most technologically controlled water on Earth, while the other negotiates a balance of natural water cycles, extreme weather, and a robust tourist economy. Providing points of reflection for similar territories where prospective sea level rise in the near future poses urgent questions about human and more-than human cohabitation, engineering, economy, and both ecological and social metabolisms. </p>
