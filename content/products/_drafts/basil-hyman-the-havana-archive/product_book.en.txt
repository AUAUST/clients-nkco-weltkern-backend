description: '<p>This lavishly illustrated book includes photographs, postcards, flyers, tickets and brochures, which conjure up the atmosphere of Cuba s past times and places and some of those associated with it. Divided into two parts; the first, a visual Archive, which was the property of a Chicago gangster Grover Dullard, is a vignette of Prohibition and proof of Havana s attractions for the Mob; and the second, an extraordinary collection of printed material from pre-revolutionary Cuba, which paint a picture of its heyday.</p>'
