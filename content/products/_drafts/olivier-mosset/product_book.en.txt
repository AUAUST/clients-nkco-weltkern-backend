description: '<p>Olivier Mosset is one of the central figures in postwar abstract painting, and a pivotal reference for generations of Swiss, European, and American painters. The acute historical awareness of Mosset&#8217;s practice is characterized by his continual questioning of the medium of painting itself and the means by which it resists the repeated assaults of &#8220;spectacle&#8221; and reification.<br /> <br /> Published on the occasion of the artist&#8217;s retrospective at MAMCO Geneva, this publication offers an extensive overview of his six-decade transatlantic painting practice: from his first experiments in Paris in the 1960s within the BMPT collective and his famous &#8220;Circle Paintings&#8221; to his shaped canvases from the 1980s and his recent monumental works, exploring &#8220;appropriation,&#8221; &#8220;radical painting,&#8221; and his interest in experimental cinema along the way. Designed by Gavillet &#038; Cie, the book proposes a journey through the rooms of the exhibition and the successive steps of Mosset&#8217;s art, thanks to generous documentation and the life-size reproduction of the paintings&#8217; details. The book&#8217;s cover is silkscreened and reproduces a life-size detail of one of Mosset&#8217;s most iconic paintings.<br /> <br /> Introduced and edited by MAMCO director Lionel Bovier, the book features three essays focusing on specific aspects of Mosset&#8217;s practice: MAMCO&#8217;s curator Paul Bernard on the artist&#8217;s filmmaking activities and how cinema constituted a visual model for Mosset; art historian Arnauld Pierre on his &#8220;Striped Paintings&#8221;; art critic Vincent Pécoil on his idiosyncratic vision of painting; and two essays by fellow painter Marcia Hafif—they met in 1978 in New York—which decipher why Mosset&#8217;s painting acted as a form of resistance to the figurative and decorative wave that swept the art scene in the late 1970s.</p>'
