  <p>In Tehran, children walking home from school would scrape their pencils against the walls, tracing their paths through the city and chanting &#8220;follow this line.&#8221; Siah Armajani (born 1939) recounts that this simple gesture speaks to the desire to mark one&#8217;s presence in space. Siah Armajani: Follow This Line asks visitors to follow the artist across a shifting terrain, first within the context of pre-revolution Iran, and later, postwar and present-day America. Though Armajani is best known today for his works of public art&#8211;bridges, gazebos, reading rooms&#8211;located across the United States and Europe, this groundbreaking exhibition argues for a thoughtful reexamination of his studio as the site of a rich and generative practice. His works engage a range of references: from Persian calligraphy to the manifesto, letter and talisman; from poetry to mathematical equations and computer programming; from the abstract expressionist canvas to American vernacular architecture, Bauhaus design and Russian constructivism.</p>
  <p>Published to accompany Armajani&#8217;s first major US retrospective, this catalog is his most comprehensive publication to date. Developed in close collaboration with the artist, it offers new scholarship on his six-decade-long career and also includes previously unpublished texts. Contributions by Nazgol Ansarinia, Sam Durant, Barbad Golshiri and Slavs and Tatars speak to Armajani&#8217;s influence on a younger generation of artists based in the United States, Europe and the Middle East.</p>
