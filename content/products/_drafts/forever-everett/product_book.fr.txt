description: '<p>Forever Everett is an hybrid publication celebrating simultaneously Daniel Everett’s photographic work and the eponymous typeface designed by Nolan Paparelli. The publication is composed of a series of 6 double-sided posters, folded twice, which becomes a large booklet when combined together, always alternating between photo- and typographic details. While both medium react to each other at an equal level as a spread, being zoomed in and fostering interesting close-up, each sheet can then be taken out and used as a single poster. This hybrid form also echoes the versatility of the typeface, showing its interesting balance between a display and text typeface. Each type poster highlights quotes from the photographer himself with different weights and sizes, showing the full spectrum of the Everett font family.</p>'
