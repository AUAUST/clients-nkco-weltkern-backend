  <p>This issue, arriving at the turn of the new year, accompanies a time of profound ecological, social, and technological transition. Despite the necessity and hope for a return to a human dimension, to a relationship with the other and especially with the natural world, we see instead a push toward other dimensions: the imminent Metaverse and the rise of cryptocurrency suggest that resources have been diverted elsewhere.</p>
  <p>The sculptures of Ser Serpas, cover story for this issue, are emblematic of such &#8220;transient moments,&#8221; as Ingrid Luquet-Gad notes. These works are the result of a process in which language literally intersects residue—materials that for society have become objects of waste, of abandonment.</p>
  <p>In some sense the world&#8217;s ecosystem is gradually losing its boundaries, entering into a new era of increasingly unstable subjectivity, as is particularly evident in Korakrit Arunanondchai&#8217;s vision of the world as Stefanie Hessler points out.</p>
