description: '<p>Self Service magazine is a Paris-based fashion and culture biannual. The publication always makes fashion photography a work of art, capturing couture in surprising scenes. Perhaps a top-brand hoodie on an unmade bed, or a matching ecru blouse and shorts in front of a schoolhouse chalkboard, and even graphic pink floral trousers against a red taffeta curtain.

Special to this issue is a portfolio called “Initiated Dialogs”, in which 11 esteemed creative minds nominated young and promising talent that are transforming industry norms and challenging dysfunctional consumerism.</p>'
